# Regression Models with Scikit-learn

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of regression models using Python's `scikit-learn` library. The project is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to building, training, and evaluating linear regression models, which are essential tools for predictive data analysis in various domains, including finance, real estate, and more.

## Introduction

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows us to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. In this project, we focus on linear regression, where the goal is to predict a continuous outcome variable (in this case, property prices) based on one or more predictor variables (such as property size, number of bedrooms, and location features).

The project utilizes a real estate dataset containing various features of properties sold over a period. The scripts guide you through the process of:

- Preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and transforming categorical variables.
- Splitting the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- Building a linear regression model using the `scikit-learn` library.
- Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to understand how well the model fits the data.
- Visualizing the results to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions against actual property prices.

This repository serves as an educational resource for those looking to understand the fundamentals of regression modeling, as well as a template for more complex predictive modeling tasks.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HedyehRahmani/House-Price-Prediction.git
```

2. Run the Python scripts to load the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

```bash
   python app.py
```

## Modeling Process

### Data Preparation

The dataset is loaded, and basic preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values and splitting the data into training and test sets.

### Linear Regression Model

The project demonstrates how to:

- Set up and train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results

After training the model, the scripts provide an analysis of the results, including visualizations of predicted vs actual values.
